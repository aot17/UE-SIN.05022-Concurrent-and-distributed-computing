# Concurrent and Distributed Programming Course with Erlang

This course addresses some of the main challenges in distributed programming, including leader election, mutual exclusion, logical timing and synchronization, graph algorithms, group communication, consensus, and more, all within a distributed context.

Programming paradigms for concurrency and distribution are explored and exemplified through the implementation of algorithms, primarily in the Erlang programming language.

The course consists of a theoretical part (lectures and exercises) and a practical part (exercises and a mini-project, conducted in a distributed environment).
Prerequisites

A strong understanding of a programming language such as C or Java is required. An introduction to Erlang, a concurrent and functional programming language, will be provided.
Course Structure

    Theoretical Component: Lectures and exercises focusing on the fundamental concepts and problems in concurrent and distributed programming.
    Practical Component: Hands-on exercises and a mini-project to implement and experiment with distributed algorithms in a real-world environment, using Erlang.
    Introduction to Erlang: Beginners will receive an introductory overview of Erlang, covering its unique features suited for concurrent and distributed programming.

This repository serves as a resource hub for the course, containing lecture notes, exercise materials, example codes, and project details pertinent to concurrent and distributed programming.
